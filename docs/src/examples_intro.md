# About the Examples

The examples in this package are designed to be practical, reproducible, and educational. They demonstrate a wide range of finite element applications and PDE model problems.

## Design Principles

- All examples can be run directly from the Julia REPL.
- Each example is a Julia module named after the file.
- Examples can serve as templates for your own projects.
- Many examples include test cases for automated verification.

## Running the Examples

To run an example (e.g., `Example212_PeriodicBoundary2D`):

1. Download the example file (see the source code link at the top of the example page).
2. Ensure all required packages are installed in your Julia environment.
3. In the Julia REPL:

    ```julia
    julia> include("Example212_PeriodicBoundary2D.jl")
    julia> Example212_PeriodicBoundary2D.main()
    ```

4. Some examples offer visual output via the optional argument `Plotter = PyPlot` or `Plotter = GLMakie` (provided the package is installed and loaded):

    ```julia
    julia> Example212_PeriodicBoundary2D.main(Plotter = PyPlot)
    ```
