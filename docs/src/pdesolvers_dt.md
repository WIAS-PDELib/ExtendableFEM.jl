# Time-dependent Solvers

For time-dependent (non-stationary) problems the user currently has these options:
- fully manual option: add custom time derivatives to the problem (i.e. a mass matrix as a BilinearOperator and necessary LinearOperators for evaluating the previous time step(s), if more than one previous time step needs to be remembered, their memorization must be handled manually, e.g. by registering further unknowns)
- fully automatic option: reframe the ProblemDescription as an ODE problem and evolve it via DifferentialEquations with ExtendableFEMDiffEQExt.jl extension (see below)

Several time-dependent examples are available where both options are implemented, see e.g. Examples103 (Burger's equation)
and Example205 (Heat equation).


## Using SciMLBase.ODEProblem and DifferentialEquations.jl

It is possible to reframe the ProblemDescription for the spatial differential operator of the PDE
as the right-hand side of an ODEProblem. Here, the ProblemDescription contains
the right-hand side description of the ODE
```math
\begin{aligned}
M u_t(t) & = b(u(t)) - A(u(t)) u(t)
\end{aligned}
```
where A and b correspond to the assembled (linearized) spatial operator and the right-hand side operators
in the ProblemDescription. Note, that A comes with a minus sign. The matrix M is the mass matrix
and can be customized somewhat (as long as it stays constant). The operators in the ProblemDescription
might depend on time (if their kernels use qpinfo.time) and will be reassembled in each time step. To avoid
this single operator reassemblies can be switched off by using the store = true argument. The full matrix
reassembly can be skipped if constant_matrix = true is used in the SolverConfiguration.


```@autodocs
Modules = [ExtendableFEM]
Pages = ["solvers_diffeq.jl", "diffeq_interface.jl"]
Order   = [:type, :function]
```

!!! note

    The solvers of DifferentialEquations should be run with the autodiff=false option
    as it is currently not possible to differentiate the right-hand side of the generated
    ODEProblem with respect to time.

## Example : 2D Heat equation

The following ProblemDescription yields the space discretisation of the
heat equation (including homogeneous boundary conditions and equivalent to the Poisson equation).
```julia
PD = ProblemDescription("Heat Equation")
u = Unknown("u"; name = "temperature")
assign_unknown!(PD, u)
assign_operator!(PD, BilinearOperator([grad(u)]; store = true, kwargs...))
assign_operator!(PD, HomogeneousBoundaryData(u))
```
Given a finite element space FES and an initial FEVector sol for the unknown, the
ODEProblem for some time interval (0,T) can be generated and solved via
```julia
prob = generate_ODEProblem(PD, FES, (0, T); init = sol)
DifferentialEquations.solve(prob, Rosenbrock23(autodiff = false), dt = 1e-3, dtmin = 1e-6, adaptive = true)
```
